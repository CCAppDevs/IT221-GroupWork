**Instructions**

_**The plan**_:
Illustrate how git workflows work with multiple people. For this assignment we will be accessing each other's files and editing them while everyone works in the same Git Branch.

_**The complication**_:
Occasionaly, this workflow can lead to merge conflicts. In order to finish a commit and push your work you must resolve any conflicts that arise.

_**The Instructions (commands below)**_:
1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone <repository address>
    ```
2. **Navigate to your repository and open code**
    
    ```
    cd IT221-GroupWork
    ```
    
    ```
    code .
    ```
3. **Checkout the development branch (specify what branch you are working in __VERY IMPORTANT__)**
    ```
    git checkout development
    ```
4. **Add a new text file with your name as the filename**
    ```
    Example: jesse.harlan.txt
    ```
5. **Add a message inside your file (School appropriate please)**
    ```
    Jesse was here
    ```
6. **Make a change in someone else's file**
    ```
    Use code to drop a change in someone elses file
    ```
7. **__Make sure you save all changes!__**
8. **Track your changes with git (stage the files)**
    ```
    git add .
    ```
9. **Commit your changes (take a snapshot)**
    ```
    git commit -m "your commit message here"
    ```
11. **Check to make sure you have the latest copy of the code before pushing**
    ```
    git pull origin development
    ```
10. **Push your changes up to github**
    ```
    git push origin development
    ```

**Side note: If you encounter a conflict**
    ```
    You must resolve any merge conflicts that occur before progressing further. Read the conflict carefully (you can display it again with git status). The basic process is like so:

    1. Open the conflicting files
    2. Choose which section to keep (or modify both sections to satisy both changes).
    3. Track your changes again
    4. Commit your changes again.
    5. Finish the push or merge.
