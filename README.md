**Instructions**

_**The plan**_:
Illustrate how git workflows work with multiple people. For this assignment we will be accessing each other's files and editing them while everyone works in the same Git Branch.

_**The complication**_:
Occasionaly, this workflow can lead to merge conflicts. In order to finish a commit and push your work you must resolve any conflicts that arise.

_**The Instructions (commands below)**_:
1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone <repository address>
    ```
2. **Navigate to your repository and open code**
    
    ```
    cd IT221-GroupWork
    ```
    
    ```
    code .
    ```
